In this project, we were given information about the number of bicycles that were rented in each day.<br>
We were asked to build 3 models that predict how many bicycles were rented in each day and compare between the models.<br>
This project is a regression problem. We were given 8,164 observations. We will analyze the given data, process it and predict the samples in the test data.<br><br>


We achieved a test RMSE score of 40.617 using "XGBoost Regressor".<br>
