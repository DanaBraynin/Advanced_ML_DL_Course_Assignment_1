# Bike Rental Prediction
**By: Raz Graider, Sophie Margolis and Dana Braynin**

In this project, we focused on analyzing information about bicycle rentals from a company's records during the years 2011 to 2013. We were given 8,164 samples and explored 12 features within our dataset, aiming to identify patterns and relationships using various techniques from statistics and machine learning with the goal of developing a strong predictor.<br>
We utilized 3 models (XGBoost, AdaBoost and Random Forest) to predict the number of bicycles rented each day and compared their performance. Our project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation based on the RMSE score.<br><br>

We achieved a test RMSE score of 40.617 using "XGBoost Regressor".<br>
We recieved a score of 100 on this assignment.
